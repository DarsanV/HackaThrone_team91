- [ ] Transaction visible on Etherscan

---

## 📱 Example Usage Flow

### 1. Upload a Violation

```
User Action: Upload image + select type
    ↓
IPFS: Image uploaded → CID: QmXxXxXx...
    ↓
Blockchain: Transaction submitted
    ↓
MetaMask: Sign transaction
    ↓
Sepolia: Processing (15-30 sec)
    ↓
✅ Confirmed! Violation ID: #0
```

### 2. View on Etherscan

## 🔐 Security Notes

### ✅ What's Secure
- Contract code is immutable
- IPFS provides content addressing
- Blockchain provides tamper-proof records
- MetaMask keeps keys secure
- All transactions are signed cryptographically

### ⚠️ Important Reminders
- **Never share your private key!**
- **This is testnet** - no real value, but treat it like mainnet
- **Keep .env file secure** - never commit to git
- **Backup your private key** securely
- **Test thoroughly** before considering mainnet

# Verify contract on Etherscan
cd contracts
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0x40B94974577C1435BC7fa03Af91AA569e94224EC

# Check contract on blockchain
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
```

## 📈 Monitor Your Contract

### Real-time Monitoring

1. **Etherscan Alerts**
   - Sign up at Etherscan.io
   - Add address to watchlist
   - Get email notifications

2. **Web3 Explorer**
   - View all transactions
   - See event logs
   - Monitor gas usage

3. **Your App**
   - "View Records" tab shows all violations
   - Real-time updates from blockchain

---

## 🎓 Understanding Gas

### What is Gas?

Gas is the fee for executing transactions on Ethereum:
- **Add Violation**: ~100,000-150,000 gas (~$0.01-0.03 on testnet, free from faucet)
- **View Violations**: Free (read-only)
- **Verify Violation**: ~50,000 gas

### Gas Tips
- ✅ Read operations are always free
- ✅ Testnet gas is free (from faucets)
- ✅ Batch operations save gas
- ✅ Lower gas prices = slower confirmation

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Contract deployed ← **You are here!**
2. ⏭️ Test upload functionality
3. ⏭️ View violations on Etherscan
4. ⏭️ Share contract address with team

### Short-term
- Add more violation types
- Implement search/filter
- Add violation statistics
- Create admin dashboard

### Long-term
- Smart contract audit
- Deploy to mainnet
- Integrate with police systems
- Mobile app development

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Transaction Failed"
→ Check gas limit and account balance
→ Ensure you're on Sepolia network

### "Network Mismatch"
→ Switch MetaMask to Sepolia test network

### "Contract Not Found"
→ Verify contract address: `0x40B94974577C1435BC7fa03Af91AA569e94224EC`

### "IPFS Upload Slow"
→ Normal behavior (10-20 seconds)
→ Consider Infura IPFS for faster uploads

### "Insufficient Funds"
→ Get more Sepolia ETH from faucet
→ Check balance on Etherscan

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Save Important Links**
   - Bookmark your contract on Etherscan
   - Save transaction hashes
   - Keep deployment info handy

2. **Monitor Gas Prices**
   - Check https://sepolia.etherscan.io/gastracker
   - Lower prices = slower but cheaper

3. **IPFS Best Practices**
   - Compress images before upload
   - Use appropriate file formats
   - Consider image size limits

4. **Development Workflow**
   - Test on local first
   - Then test on Sepolia
   - Only then consider mainnet
