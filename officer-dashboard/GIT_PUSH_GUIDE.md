## 🚀 Next Steps: Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Push to Existing GitHub Repository

If you already have a GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
- `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your repository name

---

### Option 2: Create New GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Create Repository:**
   - Repository name: `snap-n-earn-officer-dashboard`
   - Description: `Traffic violation reporting officer dashboard with MongoDB integration`
   - Choose: Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push Your Code:**

GitHub will show you commands like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snap-n-earn-officer-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Or if you want to keep the `master` branch:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/snap-n-earn-officer-dashboard.git
git push -u origin master
```

## 🔐 Authentication

### If Using HTTPS:
- GitHub will ask for username and password
- **Note:** GitHub no longer accepts passwords
- You need to use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**

**Create PAT:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
4. Generate and copy the token
5. Use this token as your password when pushing

### If Using SSH:
```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
```

Then use SSH URL:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Pushing:

1. **Remove Sensitive Data** (if any):
   - MongoDB connection strings with passwords
   - API keys
   - Secrets

   Your MongoDB URI is currently in `server/index.js`. Consider using environment variables:

   ```javascript
   // Instead of hardcoding:
   const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI || "your-connection-string";
   ```

2. **Check .gitignore**:
   Make sure these are ignored:
   - `node_modules/`
   - `.env`
   - `*.log`

3. **Review Files**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff HEAD
   ```

---
